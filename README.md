Predicting survival of Patients with Heart Failure using a Regression Model.

<h2>Regression Model Prediction</h2>
Several measures must be taken, such as descriptive data analysis of each variable to check the 
quality of the given data, such as data quality, analysis of the relationships between variables, and 
discussion of any potential transformations.

We begin by checking data quality by inspecting the datasets and looking for missing data. The 
number of missing data can be found out by using the COUNTBLANK method. This is accomplished 
by counting the number of records with missing data entries.

Since missing data is negligible and does not affect the overall data statistics much, the whole data 
row of missing data can be omitted from the dataset. The missing data of various entries overlap for 
each dataset row a lot. Much missing data is from the same row so that we can omit it without much 
thinking.

Since we have a meagre percentage of missing data, so deletion is performed where the entire record 
of missing data is removed from the dataset. Once this process is completed, the quality of the data
will be assessed.
